# üêõ Scraping Jobs Not Completing - Progress Bar Never Finishes

## Summary
Scraping jobs in the USYD Web Crawler and RAG application start successfully but never complete. The progress bar appears and shows "running" status, but jobs remain stuck indefinitely without progressing or completing. This issue affects both local development and Azure deployment.

## Environment
- **Local Development**: Works with dependencies installed
- **Azure Container Apps**: Jobs get stuck and never complete
- **Framework**: Flask + AsyncIO + Threading
- **Scraping Library**: crawl4ai 0.6.0 + Playwright
- **Background Processing**: Threading with asyncio.run()

## üîç Problem Description

### Symptoms
1. **UI Behavior**: 
   - User can select URL and click "Start Scraping"
   - Progress bar appears and shows job as "running"
   - Progress bar never advances or completes
   - Job status remains "running" indefinitely

2. **Backend Behavior**:
   - Job is created successfully in database
   - Background thread starts correctly
   - No scraping activity logs appear
   - No error messages or exceptions logged
   - Job status never updates from "running"

3. **Azure Deployment Issues**:
   - Container app health checks fail intermittently
   - Application logs show service initialization but no scraping activity
   - Container app events show readiness probe failures

### Expected Behavior
- Scraping job should progress through stages: pending ‚Üí running ‚Üí completed
- Progress bar should advance and show completion
- Scraped data should be saved to file system
- Job status should update to "completed" with result summary

## üõ†Ô∏è Architecture Overview

### Current Implementation
```
Flask App (app.py)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /api/scrape/start [POST] - Creates job and starts background thread
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /api/scrape/status/<job_id> [GET] - Checks job progress
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ScrapingService (services/scraper.py)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ create_scraping_job() - Creates DB entry
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ process_scraping_job_sync() - Main processing method
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ scrape_single_page() - Async scraping with crawl4ai
```

### Threading + AsyncIO Pattern
```python
def start_scraping():
    job_id = scraping_service.create_scraping_job(...)
    
    def process_job():
        scraping_service.process_scraping_job_sync(job_id)
    
    thread = threading.Thread(target=process_job)
    thread.daemon = True
    thread.start()
```

### Async Scraping Method
```python
async def scrape_single_page(self, url: str):
    async with AsyncWebCrawler(verbose=True) as crawler:
        result = await crawler.arun(url=url)
        return result
```

## üîß Changes Made to Fix the Issue

### 1. Updated crawl4ai API Usage (Latest Change)
**Problem**: Using deprecated `crawler.astart()` method that doesn't exist in crawl4ai 0.6.0
**Fix**: Updated to use proper context manager pattern

```python
# OLD (Broken):
crawler = AsyncWebCrawler()
await crawler.astart()
result = await crawler.arun(url)
await crawler.aclose()

# NEW (Fixed):
async with AsyncWebCrawler(verbose=True) as crawler:
    result = await crawler.arun(url=url)
```

### 2. Simplified AsyncIO Event Loop Handling
**Problem**: Complex event loop detection causing hangs
**Fix**: Always use `asyncio.run()` in background threads (new threads don't have event loops)

```python
# OLD (Complex):
try:
    loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()
    # Use ThreadPoolExecutor
except RuntimeError:
    # Use asyncio.run()

# NEW (Simple):
result = asyncio.run(self._run_async_job(job_dict, config, job_id))
```

### 3. Enhanced Logging and Debugging
**Added extensive logging throughout the process**:
- `flush_print()` statements with immediate stdout flush
- Thread start/completion logging
- Database operation logging
- Async job execution logging
- Error logging with stack traces

### 4. Improved Error Handling
- All exceptions caught and logged with full stack traces
- Job status updated to 'failed' on errors
- Database connection issues handled gracefully

### 5. Container Configuration
**Dockerfile optimizations**:
- Added `PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1`
- Forced stdout/stderr unbuffering
- Proper logging configuration

## üß™ Testing and Validation

### Local Testing Results
```bash
# Dependencies installed successfully
pip install -r requirements.txt

# crawl4ai API test fails due to missing Playwright browsers
python test_scraper.py
# Error: BrowserType.launch: Executable doesn't exist

# Need to run: playwright install
```

### Azure Deployment Status
- ‚úÖ Application starts and services initialize
- ‚úÖ Health check endpoint responds
- ‚úÖ User can create scraping jobs
- ‚ùå Scraping jobs never complete
- ‚ùå No scraping activity in logs
- ‚ùå Container readiness probes fail intermittently

## üîç Investigation Areas

### Potential Root Causes
1. **Playwright Browser Installation**: Missing in Azure container
2. **Threading/AsyncIO Interaction**: Still hanging despite fixes
3. **Container Resource Limits**: Memory/CPU constraints
4. **Network/Firewall Issues**: Outbound HTTP requests blocked
5. **Event Loop Conflicts**: AsyncIO + Flask + Threading issues

### Key Files to Investigate
- `services/scraper.py` - Main scraping logic
- `app.py` - Threading implementation 
- `Dockerfile` - Container configuration
- `requirements.txt` - Dependencies

## üéØ Next Steps for Investigation

### Immediate Actions Needed
1. **Install Playwright Browsers in Container**:
   ```dockerfile
   RUN playwright install chromium
   ```

2. **Test Locally with Full Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   playwright install
   python test_scraper.py
   ```

3. **Add Container Resource Monitoring**:
   - Monitor memory/CPU usage during scraping
   - Check for OOM kills or resource exhaustion

4. **Simplify Threading Model** (if needed):
   - Consider using Celery instead of threading
   - Or implement simple request/response with polling

### Deep Debugging Steps
1. **Add Process-Level Logging**:
   ```python
   import os, threading
   logger.info(f"Process ID: {os.getpid()}")
   logger.info(f"Thread: {threading.current_thread().name}")
   logger.info(f"Active threads: {threading.active_count()}")
   ```

2. **Test Network Connectivity**:
   ```python
   # Add test endpoint that tries HTTP request without scraping
   import requests
   result = requests.get("https://httpbin.org/get", timeout=10)
   ```

3. **Monitor Browser Process**:
   ```python
   # Add logging for browser startup/shutdown
   # Check if Chromium process starts correctly
   ```

### Alternative Approaches
1. **Replace Threading with Celery**: Use Redis-backed job queue
2. **Implement Synchronous Scraping**: Remove asyncio complexity
3. **Use Alternative Scraper**: Switch to requests + BeautifulSoup
4. **Container Debugging**: Add debugging tools to container

## üìã Current State
- ‚úÖ Code committed and pushed to main branch
- ‚úÖ crawl4ai API issues fixed
- ‚úÖ Logging enhanced throughout
- ‚ùå Playwright browsers not installed in container
- ‚ùå Scraping jobs still not completing
- ‚ùå Need to redeploy and test

## üöÄ Ready for Handoff
The codebase is in a good state with proper error handling and logging. The main suspected issue is missing Playwright browser binaries in the Azure container. An agentic coder should start by:

1. Installing Playwright browsers in the container
2. Testing the scraping functionality locally
3. Redeploying to Azure and monitoring logs
4. If still failing, investigating the threading/asyncio interaction in the container environment

All changes are documented, logged, and ready for continued development.
